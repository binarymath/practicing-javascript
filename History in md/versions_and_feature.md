# Javascript versions and features #

JavaScript has gone through several versions since its initial release in 1995. Some of the notable versions and their features include:

1. ES1 (ECMAScript 1) - This was the first version of JavaScript that was released in 1997. It introduced basic features such as variables, functions, objects, and control statements.

2. ES2 (ECMAScript 2) - This version was released in 1998 and introduced minor updates and bug fixes to ES1, including support for try/catch statements and new types of objects.

3. ES3 (ECMAScript 3) - Released in 1999, ES3 brought significant improvements to JavaScript, including support for regular expressions, better error handling with try/catch/finally statements, and more powerful string manipulation functions.

4. ES4 (ECMAScript 4) - This version was never officially released, as it was abandoned due to disagreements among stakeholders. It was intended to introduce significant changes to the language, including optional static typing and other advanced features, but it was ultimately abandoned in favor of a different approach.

5. ES5 (ECMAScript 5) - Released in 2009, ES5 was a major update to JavaScript, introducing features such as strict mode for writing more secure and optimized code, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) support, and new array and object manipulation methods.

6. ES6/ES2015 (ECMAScript 2015) - Released in 2015, ES6 was a significant update to JavaScript, bringing many new features such as block-scoped variables (let and const), arrow functions, classes, modules, promises, and more.

7. ES7/ES2016 (ECMAScript 2016) and subsequent versions - JavaScript has been undergoing regular updates since ES6, with new features being added in subsequent versions, such as async/await for handling asynchronous operations, destructuring assignments, spread and rest operators, and more.

It's important to note that JavaScript versions are also commonly referred to by their ECMAScript (ES) versions, as ECMAScript is the official standard that JavaScript is based on. Different web browsers and environments may have varying degrees of support for different ECMAScript versions, so it's important to consider compatibility when developing JavaScript applications. Modern web developers 
often use transpilers or polyfills to write code in the latest ECMAScript version while maintaining backward compatibility with older browsers.
